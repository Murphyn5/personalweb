                        <p id="bio">
                            Starting this coming October, I will be embarking on a new adventure by joining App Academy
                            to become a full-stack software engineer.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Leaving Blanchet was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made, but ultimately
                            worthwhile as I set out to pursue my newest dream. This dream had been born out of multiple
                            reasons: a passion for problem solving in a new environment, a need to develop a wider skill
                            set that will allow me to work in remote locations, and a desire to test out my talent in
                            design. Back in the summer of 2020 when I was in between teaching jobs, I had come across
                            App Academy‚Äôs open curriculum and was immediately impressed by its thoroughness and level of
                            engagement. I found myself quickly learning new programming languages and seeking out new
                            coding challenges. Most importantly, as I kept coding I realized I was having fun. This
                            experience left a lasting impression on me, and completing A/a‚Äôs program became a dream that
                            one day I wanted to realize. Furthermore, all of my past experiences have taught me that no
                            matter how challenging it might be, any dream is always worth pursuing.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I am dedicating this next chapter of my life towards a new vision of my own future. If you‚Äôd

                        <p id="bio">
                            In the summer of 2020, I was able to turn hardship into opportunity upon arriving back home
                            to
                            live
                            in Seattle for the first time in almost 9 years. Bishop Blanchet, a high school less than
                            two
                            miles
                            away from the one I graduated from, gave me the opportunity to teach as a full time
                            instructor.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This was it, I had finally made it in my profession in the community I grew up in. Although
                            the times were difficult due to the circumstances of online teaching, I felt like I had
                            found a new strength being able to reconnect with students from the same background as me.
                            Also even though the circumstances were like none I had ever faced before, I felt prepared
                            as I had just come from an environment where I had to adapt to overcome adversity. During my
                            year and a half at Blanchet I was able to guide students through courses in geometry and
                            calculus, and make connections with students in place of the interactions they would
                            normally have in a school environment. Also as an assistant coach for track and cross
                            country, I had the pleasure of being a part of a boy's team that won four straight league
                            titles (and counting) and one state title. I also helped bring back the school's chess club
                            upon returning to in person learning, which helped me form even stronger connections with
                            the student body I served. After so many years away from home, and in a time where I was
                            around so many unfamiliar faces, I was more than happy to be welcomed back to my home area
                            and give back to the community that had raised me into the person I am today. Thank you
                            Blanchet, go Bears!

                        <p id="bio">
                            With my studies behind me and a desire to keep adventuring, landing a teaching job in
                            England
                            through the Quantum Scholars program was another once in a lifetime opportunity. Throughout
                            all
                            of
                            college I had worked to become a teacher, and that work was finally taking me places I had
                            never
                            imagined traveling to.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            While the nine months I spent teaching just outside of London still feel like a dream, I
                            cherish
                            my
                            experience during that time. This is because of the obstacles that I faced, and how I
                            responded
                            to
                            the adversity of those times. The biggest obstacle faced was learning how to work through
                            imposter
                            syndrome from day 1. Although I had experienced the teacher's life during my studies, I
                            quickly
                            realized how much of my teaching strength had come from my ability to connect with students
                            through
                            having a shared background. In the UK, this strength became my biggest obstacle.
                            Furthermore,
                            having
                            just come from the ruggedness of a cross country bike trip less than a week before the first
                            day
                            of
                            school, adjusting to the formalities of the British classroom felt like being an alien from
                            a
                            different planet. Despite this challenge, I gave all of my energy each day to be the best
                            teacher I
                            could and made positive connections with each of my coworkers who did the same. From them, I
                            learned
                            what it truly meant to be dedicated to a craft, and over time I improved my ability to work
                            with
                            them as part of a team and how to operate in a school system that was completely foreign to
                            me.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Although my experience was cut short by COVID, I will never forget the connections made in
                            the
                            UK.
                            This experience teaching in another country has given me the confidence to succeed in any
                            situation.

                            Obsessed with adventure after college, I took it upon myself to continue exploring my
                            passions
                            to
                            new lengths. After spending a couple of
                            years of teaching in the local Bellingham community I embarked on a new adventure, Bike &
                            Build.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Biking across the U.S had always been in the back of my mind since hearing my grandparents
                            talk
                            about the past possibility of doing it in their youth. Learning about Bike & Build from a
                            friend
                            in
                            college made me realize I had the opportunity to actually do it. Every year the organization
                            had
                            been gatherin young adults in service-oriented cycling trips to raise money and awareness
                            for
                            the
                            affordable housing cause. Outside of having a passion for cycling, seeing the rise of
                            homelessness
                            in my local community motivated me to contribute to the cause of providing affordable
                            housing to
                            those in need. Two and half months of travel and 4,000 miles later, me and a group of twenty
                            five
                            other like minded and crazy individuals accomplished our goal and raised over $30,000
                            dollars
                            for AH
                            organizations across the U.S.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Apart from just increasing my lung capacity and giving my leg muscles a little more
                            definition,
                            Bike
                            & Build helped me form lifetime friendships and gave me an unforgettable experience in
                            community
                            outreach. It was also the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.

                            I am eternally grateful for the time I was able to spend at Western. The six years I spent
                            during my
                            undergrad and graduate studies fueled me to explore my passions, pushed me to expand,
                            challenge,
                            and
                            adjust my worldview, and allowed me seek out my place in the world.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My undergraduate studies is when I began to really explore my passions as I sought out
                            direction
                            in
                            life. For the first time I explored various and diverse fields of study, competed as a
                            varsity
                            athlete on Western‚Äôs track and field and cycling team, and began to form the beginning of
                            many
                            meaningful connections that shaped my life after college. Out of everything though, the
                            biggest
                            gift
                            I was given during this time was the opportunity to explore my love for problem solving.
                            Through
                            the
                            courses I took in mathematics and also at Fairhaven college, I developed my ability to think
                            critically and creatively throughout my studies. I found my love for learning more than
                            ever,
                            and I
                            decided to spend my graduate studies learning how to share the gift of learning with others
                            by
                            becoming a teacher. My final year where I studied as a student teacher pushed me to work
                            harder
                            than
                            ever before as I dedicated all of my energy towards helping my students become better
                            problem
                            solvers. Although the work was tireless during these years, the reward of seeing others
                            succeed
                            was
                            incomparable.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Western showed me what I love to do, gifted me with a love of helping others, and surrounded
                            me
                            with
                            an abundance of inspiring peers who have helped shape me into the person I am today.
